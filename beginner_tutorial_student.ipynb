This report will be used to help optimize 2022 event planning (e.g., fall color viewing) for park visitors and maintenance scheduling for park staff. Mr. Wuf’s wife, Mrs. Wuf, recently told him about the State Climate Office of North Carolina’s new Cardinal and Station Scout data portals. He agrees with her that it would be a great opportunity to check out these new, free tools. After some preliminary sleuthing around Station Scout, he discovered there was a National Weather Service Cooperative Observer Program (COOP; https://www.weather.gov/rah/coop) station on park property (station # 315923). How did he miss this? Once he downloads these data from Cardinal, Mr. Wuf plans to put the skills he learned in an online R programming course to the test for this real-world, work-related project.\\\n\n\n![Mr. Wuf](images/mr_wuf.png)","metadata":{},"id":"e3e32019-54b9-478b-a8ae-5deb2931f81e"},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Open Data Science\n\n### What is Open Data and Reproducible Science?\n\n- Without looking at the section below, how would you define open data? Answer [here](PollEv.com/ngawron226).\n\n- How would you define reproducible (and open) science? Answer [here](PollEv.com/ngawron226).\n\nOpen data documents and shares research data openly for re-use.\n\nOpen data research aims to transform research by pushing change in the way that research is carried out and disseminated by digital tools. Open data should be:\n\n- Publicly available: Open data is freely available on the internet.\n- Reusable: Proper licensing is essential for research outputs so that users know any limitations on re-use\n- Transparent: With appropriate metadata to explain how research output was produced and what it contains\n- You can easily share what you did with your colleagues, collaborators, etc. and it’s easy to make changes and rerun analysis with different settings.\n\n\nWe note that reproducible science is when an authors such as Mr. Wuf would be able to provide all the necessary data and the R code to run their analysis again, re-creating the results. \n\nWhen we combine these idea together - we get the goals for this tutorial. \n\nFor more information go to this [handbook](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/reproducible-research/reproducible-research.html) on the subject.
