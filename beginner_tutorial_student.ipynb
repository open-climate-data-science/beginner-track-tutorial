This report will be used to help optimize 2022 event planning (e.g., fall color viewing) for park visitors and maintenance scheduling for park staff. Mr. Wuf’s wife, Mrs. Wuf, recently told him about the State Climate Office of North Carolina’s new Cardinal and Station Scout data portals. He agrees with her that it would be a great opportunity to check out these new, free tools. After some preliminary sleuthing around Station Scout, he discovered there was a National Weather Service Cooperative Observer Program (COOP; https://www.weather.gov/rah/coop) station on park property (station # 315923). How did he miss this? Once he downloads these data from Cardinal, Mr. Wuf plans to put the skills he learned in an online R programming course to the test for this real-world, work-related project.\\\n","\n","\n","![Mr. Wuf](images/mr_wuf.png)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"0f2a2c48-68cc-4d00-87fe-94317bfe5ff8","metadata":{},"source":["## Open Data Science\n","\n","### What is Open Data and Reproducible Science?\n","\n","- Without looking at the section below, how would you define open data?
