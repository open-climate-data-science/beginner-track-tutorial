# Tutorial Beginner Track

Created by  [Nick Gawron](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ngawrondata/) and [Livia Popa](https://www.linkedin.com/in/livia-popa-23a018183/) for the 
Open Climate Data Science Workshop hosted by the North Carolina State Climate Office in partnership with the North Carolina Institute for Climate Studies.

We will be tackling these objectives:

- *Define* open data and reproducible science
- *Describe* how to navigate important aspects of the R/RStudio user-interface
- *Recall* how to extract public data from a web portal (Cardinal) and import it into a  data software (R/RStudio)
- *Demonstrate* understanding of dataset and statistical software through exploratory data analysis plots and numerical summaries


## File Breakdown

- Images Folder: Images live here that are related to our reports and tutorial notebooks
- Data Folder: Where various data files live for analysis in beginner tutorials. Contents are below:
    - cardinal.xlsx: Data from the ECONet Database looking at many variables over a span of  
    - raw_coop_data.csv
    - raw_cardinal_data.xlsx
- NCSCO Additional Resources.csv: A csv file of various data science websites and book resouces. 
- beginner_tutorial.Rmd: An R notebook file that has been used to formulate the Beginner tutorial. Can be knitted to create an HTML file versio of the completed tutorial. 
- beginner_tutorial_student.ipynb: Student version of the tutorial with incomplete code blocks to be filled in during live coding sessions. Note this is a markdown notebook written for the R language.  
- beginner_tutorial_teacher.ipynb: Commpleted Beginner Track tutorial with complied images and results included. Note this is a markdown notebook written for the R language.
