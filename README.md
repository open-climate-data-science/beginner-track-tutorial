# Tutorial Beginner Track
Open Climate Data Science Workshop repository for the beginner track tutorial.

We will be tackling these objectives:

- *Define* open data and reproducible science
- *Describe* how to navigate important aspects of the R/RStudio user-interface
- *Recall* how to extract public data from a web portal (Cardinal) and import it into a  data software (R/RStudio)
- *Demonstrate* understanding of dataset and statistical software through exploratory data analysis plots and numerical summaries
