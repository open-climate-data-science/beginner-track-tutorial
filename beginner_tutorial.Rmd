# OCDS Intro Track Tutorial{.tabset}


## Tutorial Learning Goals

Welcome to the NCSCO OCDS Intro track tutorial. We are  [Nick Gawron](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ngawrondata/) and [Livia Popa](https://www.linkedin.com/in/livia-popa-23a018183/), we will be working with you through today's tutorial.  We will be using R studio for today's session. 

We will be tackling these objectives:

- *Define* open data and reproducible science
- *Describe* how to navigate important aspects of the R/RStudio user-interface
- *Recall* how to extract public data from a web portal (Cardinal) and import it into a  data software (R/RStudio)
- *Demonstrate* understanding of dataset and statistical software through exploratory data analysis plots and numerical summaries

## Meet Mr. Wuf!

Mr. Wuf works for Mount Mitchell State Park in Burnsville, NC and was recently asked by his boss to write a report summarizing rainfall and temperature data for 2021. This report will be used to help optimize 2022 event planning (e.g., fall color viewing) for park visitors and maintenance scheduling for park staff. Mr. Wuf’s wife, Mrs. Wuf, recently told him about the State Climate Office of North Carolina’s new Cardinal and Station Scout data portals. He agrees with her that it would be a great opportunity to check out these new, free tools. After some preliminary sleuthing around Station Scout, he discovered there was a National Weather Service Cooperative Observer Program (COOP; https://www.weather.gov/rah/coop) station on park property (station # 315923). How did he miss this? Once he downloads these data from Cardinal, Mr. Wuf plans to put the skills he learned in an online R programming course to the test for this real-world, work-related project.\

## Open Data Science

### What is Open Data and Reproducible Science?

Open data documents and shares research data openly for re-use.

Open data research aims to transform research by pushing change in the way that research is carried out and disseminated by digital tools. Open data should be:

- Publicly available: Open data is freely available on the internet.
- Reusable: Proper licensing is essential for research outputs so that users know any limitations on re-use
- Transparent: With appropriate metadata to explain how research output was produced and what it contains
- You can easily share what you did with your colleagues, collaborators, etc. and it’s easy to make changes and rerun analysis with different settings.

## R Basics 

### The Panel Layout


RStudio has four main panes each in a quadrant of your screen: *Console* , *Source Editor*, *Workspace Browser* (and History), and *Plots* (and Files, Packages, Help). These can also be adjusted under the ‘Preferences’ menu. Note that there might be subtle differences between RStudio installations on different operating systems. We will discuss each of the panes in turn.


#### Console

The console is a great tool that is a calculator and let's us write / execute one line commands. 


We can also do one line commands and create variables thanks to the assign operator `<-`

#### Source Editor 


Mr.Wuf may want to write programs that are quite complex and may need a few more lines than the console. The Source Editor can help you open, edit and execute these longer programs. 

How would you start a new project? Simple: 

1. Use Windows Explorer and navigate to the file BONUS/the_new_age.R.

2. Now make RStudio the default application to open .R files (right click on the file Name and set RStudio to open it as the default if it isn’t already)

3. Now double click on the file – this will open it in RStudio in the Source Editor in the top left pane.


How do we execute code? 

- Execute a single line (Run icon or *Ctrl+Enter*). Note that the cursor can be anywhere on the line and one does not need to highlight anything — do this for the code on line 2
- Execute multiple lines (Highlight lines with the cursor, then Run icon or *Ctrl+Enter*) 
- Execute the whole script (Source icon or *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*)


What kind of files are we working with? 

- Today, you will be working with a `.R` file. This allows us to write and execude code with comments. 

- This html file you may be viewing was created in another kind of a file called a `.Rmd` file. Here we can create documents or files with formatted text that you are reading **right now** - as wel as R code. 


#### Workspace 


The Environment or Workspace pane is very useful as it shows you what objects (something we will go over soon) you have in your environment (workspace). You can see the values for objects with a single value and for those that are longer R will tell you their class. When you have data in your environment that have two dimensions (rows and columns) you may click on them and they will appear in the Source Editor pane like a spreadsheet.


#### Plots 


The last pane has many uses but for one - allows us to visualize plots, and see our current directory (set of folders where our programs live). 


### What are libraries?


- Part of the reason `R` has become so popular is the vast array of packages available at the cran and bioconductor repositories. 

- In the last few years, the number of packages has grown exponentially!

- Helpful tools to do data analysis. 

- Lets Install One: 

```{r}
# This will usually go in the console
install.packages("ggplot2")
```

- Once we have this package installed, all we need to do in the future on our machine is call it
  - This is done with the `library` command
  - So at the start of your script you should: 
  
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
```



### Data Types

- Date: this data type is assigned to dates such as 2022-03-02 for March 2, 2022
- Character: `"a"`, `"NC State"`
- Numeric (real or decimal): `2`, `13.6`
- Integer: `2L` (the `L` tells R to store this as an integer)
- Logical: `TRUE`, `FALSE`
- Complex: `1+4i`(complex numbers with real and imaginary parts)



### Using data Inspection Functions

- A function is helper code that will take an input and give an output
- `str` is a powerful function that allows you to determine what kind of variable we are working with
- `length` is a function that tells you how long objects are
Examples:

```{r}
help(sum)
```



```{r}
sum(2,2)
wuf <- c(1,2,3)
str(wuf)

length(wuf)

```


```{r}
head(iris)
str(iris)
length(iris)
```






###  Importing From Cardinal

- Cardinal is a high-powered, user-oriented, one-stop-shop for North Carolina weather and climate data housed at the North Carolina State Climate Office. 
- Cardinal makes weather and climate data more accessible to users, with features and prompts that take the guesswork out of station and parameter identification and selection.
- This is a great resoucre for Mr.Wuf!

```{r}
library(readr)
cardinal <- read_csv("cardinal_data.csv")
#cardinal%>%filter(colnames(cardinal)!="MV")
```




```{r echo=F}
cardinal_raw <- read_csv("cardinal_data.csv", 
     col_types = list(`Average Air Temperature (F)` = col_number(), 
         `Maximum Air Temperature (F)` = col_number(), 
         `Minimum Air Temperature (F)` = col_number(), 
         `Average Experimental Leaf Wetness (mV)` = col_number(), 
         `Total Precipitation (in)` = col_number(), 
         `Average Relative Humidity (%)` = col_number(), 
         `Average Soil Moisture (m3/m3)` = col_number(), 
         `Average Soil Temperature (F)` = col_number(), 
         `Average Solar Radiation (W/m2)` = col_number(), 
         `Average Station Pressure (mb)` = col_number()))

```



### Cleaning Data 


- usually a lot more messy 
- R can handle a lot of small details 


```{r}

# drop rows of missing values 
cardinal<-drop_na(cardinal_raw)

#determine data types of all cols 
str(cardinal)

#create a date 
cardinal$Date<-as.Date(cardinal$Date, tryFormats= c("%m/%d/%y"))
view(cardinal)

#changes col names
colnames(cardinal)=c("date","AvgT","MaxT","MinT","AvgLw","Tprep","AvgHum","AvgSm","AvgSt","AvgSr","AvgStp")
```


## Making New Data

### When does it Rain ? 

```{r}
#me making new data

cardinal$IfRain<- (cardinal$Tprep>0)
cardinal$IfRain<-as.factor(as.integer(cardinal$IfRain))
cardinal

```



### Month Factor variable

- Factor variable is a category or bin we can place a value in. 

```{r}

# month variable 
cardinal$month<-month(cardinal$date)
cardinal$month<-as.factor(cardinal$month)

# str factor
str(cardinal)
```


###  Numerical Variable, Rain Difference

- Dollar sign + "Name of Variable"

```{r}
cardinal$TDiff <- cardinal$MaxT-cardinal$MinT
```



## Numerical Summaries


### What are they ?

- Help us determine basic trends in data from printouts. 

- Summary gives as a 5 number summary of numeric variables

- Basic counts of factor variables

```{r}
summary(cardinal)
```

- Frequency Table to compare categorical / factor variables.

```{r}
# Frequency Table 
table(cardinal$month,cardinal$IfRain)
```





## Plotting Basics  


- Simple visual of frequency count

```{r}
# base plots in R, categorical variables
#does a count
plot(cardinal$IfRain,main ='Frequency Bar Plot of Rain Occurance',xlab="Occurence of Rain (0-No, 1- Yes)",ylab = "Number of Days")

```




- We will be using a package called `ggplot2`.

- Here is a good link: https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/

- Two basic functions: ggplot() & geom_plottype
  - Note we have not even had a title or label specs yet 

```{r}
# first ggplot figure

ggplot(cardinal,aes(x= date ,y= AvgLw))+ geom_point()
```





- Maybe show total precip vs month as bar chart.


```{r}
library(ggplot2)
boxpRain<-ggplot(cardinal,aes(x=month,y=Tprep))+geom_boxplot()
```

- These dots indicate outliers in out data- we can make this plot easier to visualize manually

```{r}
boxpRain+ylim(0, .75)
```



- Observe correlation and possible trend numerical variables

- Using cheatsheet, we can find a lot more plot types and options!

  - Note the use of `labs` statement


```{r}
ggplot(cardinal,aes(x=date,y=AvgT))+geom_line()+labs(title="Total Daily Rainfall by Date",y="Average Tempurature (F) ", x= "Date")
```

- options are very versatile inside a `+geom_statement()`

- We can use the cheatsheet to find out information about this 

- Note how we change atributes inside the `aes` statment

```{r}

ggplot(cardinal,aes(x=AvgT)) + geom_histogram(color="green",fill="orange")+labs(x="Average Temperature", y="Day",title ="Histogram of Average Temperature in Lake Wheeler")

# title and all labels included in one more statement 
```

- One popular option is to color-code based off of a categorial / factor variable 

- See the difference when we include `aes(col=month)`

- Below is a scatter plot

```{r}

# general plot
ggplot(cardinal,aes(x=AvgHum,y=AvgLw))+geom_point()

# coloring by month to observe trends
ggplot(cardinal,aes(x=AvgHum,y=AvgLw))+geom_point(aes(col=month))
```


- We can also use categorical variables on the x-axis

```{r}

# + geom_boxplot is a great tool to observe spreads

ggplot(cardinal,aes(x=month , y = TDiff))+geom_boxplot()
```


- Box-plots are cumbersome and not super helpful in visalization. 


### How could we make this boxplot better? 

- Note we are looking at average daily tempurature

```{r}

# + geom_boxplot is a great tool to observe spreads

ggplot(cardinal,aes(x=month , y = AvgT))+geom_boxplot()
```


### Fancy Plot Time


- Inspiration from ggridges documentation

- We want to stylize the boxplot from the above statement       

- We will be using a few libraries here: remeber to use `install.packages("library_name")` first before running the library statment. 

- The below panel shows us librares we need

```{r}


library(viridis)     ## color palette
library(ggridges)    ## ridges
library(hrbrthemes)  ## plot theme
```


- we will walk you through the ggplot options for this plot! 
s
```{r}

ggplot(cardinal, aes(x = AvgT, y = month, fill = ..x..)) +
  
  geom_density_ridges_gradient(scale = 2, rel_min_height = 0.01, gradient_lwd = 1.) +
  
  scale_x_continuous(expand = c(0.01, 0)) +
  
  scale_y_discrete(expand = c(0.01, 0)) +
  
  scale_fill_viridis(name = "Temp. [ºF]", option = "C") +
  
  labs(title = 'Temperatures at  Lake Wheeler',
       subtitle = 'Mean temperatures (Fahrenheit) by month for 2020-2021\nData: ECONet Station', 
       x = "Mean Temperature") +
  
  theme_ridges(font_size = 13, grid = TRUE) + theme(axis.title.y = element_blank())
