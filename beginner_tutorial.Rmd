# OCDS Intro Track Tutorial{.tabset}


## Tutorial Learning Goals

Welcome to the NCSCO OCDS Intro track tutorial. We are  [Nick Gawron](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ngawrondata/) and [Livia Popa](https://www.linkedin.com/in/livia-popa-23a018183/), we will be working with you through today's tutorial.  We will be using R studio for today's session. 

We will be tackling these objectives:

- *Define* open data and reproducible science
- *Describe* how to navigate important aspects of the R/RStudio user-interface
- *Recall* how to extract public data from a web portal (Cardinal) and import it into a  data software (R/RStudio)
- *Demonstrate* understanding of dataset and statistical software through exploratory data analysis plots and numerical summaries

### Meet Mr. Wuf!

Mr. Wuf works for Mount Mitchell State Park in Burnsville, NC and was recently asked by his boss to write a report summarizing rainfall and temperature data for 2021. This report will be used to help optimize 2022 event planning (e.g., fall color viewing) for park visitors and maintenance scheduling for park staff. Mr. Wuf’s wife, Mrs. Wuf, recently told him about the State Climate Office of North Carolina’s new Cardinal and Station Scout data portals. He agrees with her that it would be a great opportunity to check out these new, free tools. After some preliminary sleuthing around Station Scout, he discovered there was a National Weather Service Cooperative Observer Program (COOP; https://www.weather.gov/rah/coop) station on park property (station # 315923). How did he miss this? Once he downloads these data from Cardinal, Mr. Wuf plans to put the skills he learned in an online R programming course to the test for this real-world, work-related project.\

## Open Data Science

### What is Open Data and Reproducible Science?

- Without looking at the section below, how would you define open data?

- How would you define reproducible (and open) science?

Open data documents and shares research data openly for re-use.

Open data research aims to transform research by pushing change in the way that research is carried out and disseminated by digital tools. Open data should be:

- Publicly available: Open data is freely available on the internet.
- Reusable: Proper licensing is essential for research outputs so that users know any limitations on re-use
- Transparent: With appropriate metadata to explain how research output was produced and what it contains
- You can easily share what you did with your colleagues, collaborators, etc. and it’s easy to make changes and rerun analysis with different settings.


We note that reproducible science is when an authors such as Mr. Wuf would be able to provide all the necessary data and the R code to run their analysis again, re-creating the results. 

When we combine these idea together - we get the goals for this tutorial. 

For more information go to this [handbook](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/reproducible-research/reproducible-research.html) on the subject. 

## R Basics 

### The Panel Layout


RStudio has four main panes each in a quadrant of your screen: *Console* , *Source Editor*, *Workspace Browser* (and History), and *Plots* (and Files, Packages, Help). These can also be adjusted under the ‘Preferences’ menu. 

#### Console

The console is a great tool that is a calculator and let's us write / execute one line commands. 


We can also do one line commands and create variables thanks to the assign operator `<-`

Try copying and pasting the code below: 

```{r}
# this comment will not run! 
100+(124/2-10)

sumOfNumbers<-3+1+4+1
```


#### Source Editor 


Mr.Wuf may want to write programs that are quite complex and may need a few more lines than the console. The Source Editor can help you open, edit and execute these longer programs. 

How would you start a new project? Simple: 

1. Use Windows Explorer and navigate to the file BONUS/the_new_age.R.

2. Now make RStudio the default application to open .R files (right click on the file Name and set RStudio to open it as the default if it isn’t already)

3. Now double click on the file – this will open it in RStudio in the Source Editor in the top left pane.


How do we execute code? 

- Execute a single line (Run icon or *Ctrl+Enter*). Note that the cursor can be anywhere on the line and one does not need to highlight anything — do this for the code on line 2

- Execute multiple lines (Highlight lines with the cursor, then Run icon or *Ctrl+Enter*)

- Execute the whole script (Source icon or *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*)


What kind of files are we working with? 

- Today, you will be working with a `.R` file. This allows us to write and execute code with comments. 

- This html file you may be viewing was created in another kind of a file called a `.Rmd` file. Here we can create documents or files with formatted text that you are reading **right now** - as well as R code. 


#### Workspace 


The Environment or Workspace pane is very useful as it shows you what objects (something we will go over soon) you have in your environment (workspace). You can see the values for objects with a single value and for those that are longer R will tell you their class. When you have data in your environment that have two dimensions (rows and columns) you may click on them and they will appear in the Source Editor pane like a spreadsheet.


#### Plots 


The last pane has many uses but for one - allows us to visualize plots, and see our current directory (set of folders where our programs live). 

When you run a command for a certain plot - in the console or in a .R file from the Source Editor, it will show up in this panel. Run the code below to see this happen. (Note you don't need to understand this plot- we will explain plotting mechanics later!).

```{r}
ggplot(iris,aes(x=Sepal.Length,y=Sepal.Width))+geom_point()+labs(x="Length", y="Width")
```


Here is a link to [more rescoures](https://datacarpentry.org/genomics-r-intro/01-introduction/index.html) for getting yourself familiarized with the layout of R.


### What are libraries?


- Part of the reason `R` has become so popular is the vast array of packages available at the cran and bioconductor repositories. 

- In the last few years, the number of packages has grown exponentially!

- Helpful tools to do data analysis. 

- Lets Install One: 

Use this code for the first time
`install.packages("ggplot2")`

- Once we have this package installed, all we need to do in the future on our machine is call it
  - This is done with the `library` command
  - So at the start of your script you should: `library(ggplot2)`




### Data Types

- Date: this data type is assigned to dates such as 2022-03-02 for March 2, 2022
- Character: `"a"`, `"NC State"`
- Numeric (real or decimal): `2`, `13.6`
- Integer: `2L` (the `L` tells R to store this as an integer)
- Logical: `TRUE`, `FALSE`
- Complex: `1+4i`(complex numbers with real and imaginary parts)



### Using data Inspection Functions / functions in General 

- A function is helper code that will take an input and give an output

- One useful pair of functions we can use are:  `getwd()` and `setwd()`
  -`getwd()` is a command that tells you the current file location, and where R will save  project files you create. 
  -`setwd()` is a function that will let you input a file directory, in quoted string, inside the parenthesis 
 


- `str` is a powerful function that allows you to determine what kind of variable we are working with
- `length` is a function that tells you how long objects are Examples:

```{r}
help(sum)
```



```{r}
sum(2,2)


str(2)

str("two")

wuf <- c(1,2,3)
str(wuf)

length(wuf)

```


```{r}
head(iris)
str(iris)
length(iris)
```

 


###  Importing From Cardinal

- Cardinal is a high-powered, user-oriented, one-stop-shop for North Carolina weather and climate data housed at the North Carolina State Climate Office. 

- Cardinal makes weather and climate data more accessible to users, with features and prompts that take the guesswork out of station and parameter identification and selection.

- This is a great resource for Mr.Wuf!

- We can implement code to import our external data
  - Or use the IMPORT Button in the Environment Panel!

<font size="24"> The Link is [Here](https://products.climate.ncsu.edu/cardinal/request/)! </font>
\center

Instead of going thru all the specifications and time to request data: 
<center> 
<font size="24">Download the [raw_cardinal_data.xlsx](raw_cardinal_data.xlsx). 
 </font>
\center

```{r}
raw_cardinal_data <- read_excel("raw_cardinal_data.xlsx", 
    col_types = c("text", "numeric", "numeric", 
        "numeric", "numeric", "numeric", 
        "numeric", "numeric"))
```





### Cleaning Data 


- usually a lot more messy 
- R can handle a lot of small details 


```{r}

# drop rows of missing values 
cardinal<-drop_na(raw_cardinal_data)

#determine data types of all cols 
str(raw_cardinal_data)


#changes col names
colnames(cardinal)=c("date","MaxT_degF","AvgT_degF","MinT_degF","cool_degDays","grow_degDays","heat_degDays","TPrep_in")


#create a date 
cardinal$date<-as.Date(cardinal$date)

str(cardinal)
```


## Making New Data

### When does it Rain ? 

```{r}
#me making new data

cardinal$IfRain<- (cardinal$TPrep_in>0)
cardinal$IfRain<-as.factor(as.integer(cardinal$IfRain))
cardinal

```



### Month Factor variable

- Factor variable is a category or bin we can place a value in. 

```{r}

# month variable 
cardinal$month<-month(cardinal$date)
cardinal$month<-as.factor(cardinal$month)

# str factor
str(cardinal)
```


###  Numerical Variable, Rain Difference

- Dollar sign + "Name of Variable"

```{r}
cardinal$TDiff_degF <- cardinal$MaxT_degF-cardinal$MinT_degF
```



## Numerical Summaries


### What are they ?

- Help us determine basic trends in data from printouts. 

- Summary gives as a 5 number summary of numeric variables

- Basic counts of factor variables

```{r}
summary(cardinal)
```

- Frequency Table to compare categorical / factor variables.
  - Several kinds!
  - Depends on the number of categorical variables present. 

```{r}
# Frequency Table 
table(cardinal$IfRain)

#changes level names!
levels(cardinal$IfRain)<-c("No", "Yes")


# two level table
tabl2Way<-table(cardinal$month,cardinal$IfRain)

tabl2Way
```


## Plotting Basics  


### Base R Plotting

- Simple visual of frequency count

```{r}
# base plots in R, categorical variables
#does a count
plot(cardinal$IfRain)

```


- This barplot shows the frequency of how many times it rained vs. did not rain. 
- This is for the entire dataset spanning across all years.


- In standard R, we can create a barplot with a standard table

```{r}

plot(tabl2Way,main ='Proportion Bar Plot of Rain Occurance',xlab="Occurence of Rain (0-No, 1- Yes)",ylab = "Proportion of Days")
```

### GGPLOT Plotting

- Base R is limited in usage. 

- We will be using a package called `ggplot2`.

- Here is a good link: https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/

- Two basic functions: `ggplot()` & `geom_plottype`
  - Note we have not even had a title or label specs yet 

```{r}
# first ggplot figure

ggplot(cardinal,aes(x= date ,y= heat_degDays))+ geom_point()
```

- This is a scatter plot showing the distribution of Heat Accumulation Days across all years. 
- The highest point is in January of each year. 
- We observes sinusoidal nature

- How could we improve this plot?

#### How Would You Modify This?

- Let's say we wanted to plot Max temperature as a scatter plot over time? How would you modify the code from the above block?

```{r}
# second ggplot figure

ggplot(cardinal,aes(x= date ,y= MaxT_degF))+ geom_point()
```





#### plots with *Layers* in ggplot2

- We can also observe correlation and possible trend numerical variables

- Using cheatsheet, we can find a lot more plot types and Layer Options!

  - Note the use of `labs` statement, we will use that next!


```{r}
ggplot(cardinal,aes(x=date,y=AvgT_degF))+geom_line()+labs(title="Total Average Temperature by Date",y="Average Tempurature (F) ", x= "Date")
```

- This line graph shows the total average temperature by date. Temperature generally increases in the spring and summer months, with peaks and troughs within each month.

- options are very versatile inside a `+geom_statement()`, or a *plot layer*

- We can use the cheatsheet to find out information about this 

- Note how we change atributes inside the `aes` statment

```{r}

ggplot(cardinal,aes(x=AvgT_degF)) + geom_histogram(color="green",fill="orange")+labs(x="Average Temperature", y="Day",title ="Histogram of Average Temperature in Lake Wheeler")

# title and all labels included in one more statement 
```

- This histogram shows the average temperature given a count of days. 

- Statistically we see this data is pretty right skewed- something we could look into is if this is the case for all months? (We will look into this later!)


- One popular option is to color-code based off of a categorial / factor variable 

- See the difference when we include `aes(col=month)`

- Below is a scatter plot

```{r}

# general plot
TempPlot<-ggplot(cardinal,aes(x=MinT_degF,y=MaxT_degF))+geom_point()
TempPlot

# coloring by month to observe trends
ggplot(cardinal,aes(x=MinT_degF,y=MaxT_degF))+geom_point(aes(col=month))
```

- This scatterplot shows the  Maximum tempurature recorded in a day agasint the  minimum tempurature recorded. We note this variable is color coded by month. 

#### Categorical Variables on an Axis



- Note we can save our plots with a variable name using the `<-` symbol 


```{r}

boxpRain<-ggplot(cardinal,aes(x=month,y=TPrep_in))+geom_boxplot()
boxpRain
```


- This is a boxplot of total precipitation within each month. 
- These dots indicate outliers in out data

- We can add edits, with new layers,  to a specific ggplot2 object

```{r}
boxpRain+ylim(0, 1.25)+labs()
```

- By changing the range of the boxplots we can now see the distribution of the data more easily.

- Only issue is that boxplots can be confusing


- Mr. Wuf wants a more cumulative assessment for rainfall
- We want to create a barplot with total Rain Per Month

- This will require us to go outside of the `cardinal` data set we are working with!



```{r}
#creates a data frame for just this one bar plot!
JustMonthRainTot<-cardinal%>%group_by(month)%>%summarise(Rain = sum(TPrep_in))
str(JustMonthRainTot)
```


- With the new data set we created, `JustMonthRainTot`, we can now create the barplot!


```{r}
library(ggplot2)


# below there is  an error in the code 
#ggplot(JustMonthRainTot,aes(x=month,y=Rain))+geom_bar()


```

- What do we know about Bar Plots that could help us with this? **Text Poll Link Here**

- We somehow need to change how our data is being plotted. Let's look at `?geom_bar`


- Thanks to our investigation, Mr.Wuf knows he cannot use `geom_bar()` stated as is for this kind of plot. 


```{r}
ggplot(JustMonthRainTot,aes(x=month,y=Rain))+geom_col()+labs(y = "Total Rainfall (in)",x = "Month")
```


- To quickly show the power of *ggplot*, observe how we can create this plot without the tidyverse commands from a few boxed above: 

```{r}
ggplot(cardinal,aes(x=month,y=TPrep_in))+geom_col()+labs(y = "Total Rainfall (in)",x = "Month")
```



- We can also use categorical variables on the x-axis, if they relate to a variable in our data frame!

```{r}

# + geom_boxplot is a great tool to observe spreads

ggplot(cardinal,aes(x=month , y = TDiff_degF))+geom_boxplot()
```

- This boxplot shows the range of temperature across each month. In the summer the range decreases, meaning there is less variation in temperature when compared to winter months.

- Box-plots are cumbersome and not super helpful in visalization. 

- How could we improve this boxplot?

### How could we make this boxplot better? 


- Note we are looking at average daily temperature

```{r}

# + geom_boxplot is a great tool to observe spreads

tempBox<- ggplot(cardinal,aes(x=month , y = AvgT_degF))+geom_boxplot()
tempBox
```

- We could add a title and approraite labels! 

```{r}
tempBox+labs(x="Month",y=" Average Tempurature (F)",title="Dsitribution of Tempuratures By Month")+theme_light()
```



- This is a boxplot showing the spread of average temperature across months. There are a few outliers in some months and the range of values is smaller in the summer.

### Fancy Plot Time



- Inspiration from ggridges documentation

- We want to stylize the boxplot from the above statement       

- We will be using a few libraries here: remeber to use `install.packages("library_name")` first before running the library statment. 

- The below panel shows us librares we need

```{r}
library(viridis)     ## color palette
library(ggridges)    ## ridges
library(hrbrthemes)  ## plot theme
```


- we will walk you through the ggplot options for this plot!  

```{r}

ggplot(cardinal, aes(x = AvgT_degF, y = month, fill = ..x..)) +
  
  geom_density_ridges_gradient(scale = 2, rel_min_height = 0.01, gradient_lwd = 1.) +
  
  scale_x_continuous(expand = c(0.01, 0)) +
  
  scale_y_discrete(expand = c(0.01, 0)) +
  
  scale_fill_viridis(name = "Temp. [ºF]", option = "C") +
  
  labs(title = 'Temperatures at  Burnsville NC',
       subtitle = 'Mean temperatures (Fahrenheit) by month for 2020-2021\nData: COOP Station', 
       x = "Mean Temperature") +
  
  theme_ridges(font_size = 13, grid = TRUE) + theme(axis.title.y = element_blank())

```

- This plot shows the distribution of temperature within each month. 

- The density plots are colored by temperature, making it easier to visualize the spread of temperature. 


## Bonus Section



Here we are applying very similar concepts to the tutorial above - with new a new data set! Here we are using an ECOnet station in Raliegh North Carolina.

         `Average Solar Radiation (W/m2)` = col_number(), 
         `Average Station Pressure (mb)` = col_number()))

```





### Cleaning Data 


- usually a lot more messy 
- R can handle a lot of small details 


```{r}

# drop rows of missing values 
cardinal<-drop_na(cardinal_raw)

#determine data types of all cols 
str(cardinal)

#create a date 
cardinal$Date<-as.Date(cardinal$Date, tryFormats= c("%m/%d/%y"))
view(cardinal)

#changes col names
colnames(cardinal)=c("date","AvgT","MaxT","MinT","AvgLw","Tprep","AvgHum","AvgSm","AvgSt","AvgSr","AvgStp")
```


### Making New Data

#### When does it Rain ? 

```{r}
#me making new data

cardinal$IfRain<- (cardinal$Tprep>0)
cardinal$IfRain<-as.factor(as.integer(cardinal$IfRain))
cardinal

```



### Month Factor variable

- Factor variable is a category or bin we can place a value in. 

```{r}

# month variable 
cardinal$month<-month(cardinal$date)
cardinal$month<-as.factor(cardinal$month)

# str factor
str(cardinal)
```


###  Numerical Variable, Rain Difference

- Dollar sign + "Name of Variable"

```{r}
cardinal$TDiff <- cardinal$MaxT-cardinal$MinT
```



### Numerical Summaries


#### What are they ?

- Help us determine basic trends in data from printouts. 

- Summary gives as a 5 number summary of numeric variables

- Basic counts of factor variables

```{r}
summary(cardinal)
```

- Frequency Table to compare categorical / factor variables.

```{r}
# Frequency Table 
table(cardinal$month,cardinal$IfRain)
```





### Plotting Basics  


- Simple visual of frequency count

```{r}
# base plots in R, categorical variables
#does a count
plot(cardinal$IfRain,main ='Frequency Bar Plot of Rain Occurance',xlab="Occurence of Rain (0-No, 1- Yes)",ylab = "Number of Days")

```




- We will be using a package called `ggplot2`.

- Here is a good link: https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/

- Two basic functions: ggplot() & geom_plottype
  - Note we have not even had a title or label specs yet 

```{r}
# first ggplot figure

ggplot(cardinal,aes(x= date ,y= AvgLw))+ geom_point()
```





- Maybe show total precip vs month as bar chart.


```{r}
library(ggplot2)
boxpRain<-ggplot(cardinal,aes(x=month,y=Tprep))+geom_boxplot()
```


- These dots indicate outliers in out data- we can make this plot easier to visualize manually

```{r}
boxpRain+ylim(0, .75)
```



- Observe correlation and possible trend numerical variables

- Using cheatsheet, we can find a lot more plot types and options!

  - Note the use of `labs` statement


```{r}
ggplot(cardinal,aes(x=date,y=AvgT))+geom_line()+labs(title="Total Daily Rainfall by Date",y="Average Tempurature (F) ", x= "Date")
```

- options are very versatile inside a `+geom_statement()`

- We can use the cheatsheet to find out information about this 

- Note how we change atributes inside the `aes` statment

```{r}

ggplot(cardinal,aes(x=AvgT)) + geom_histogram(color="green",fill="orange")+labs(x="Average Temperature", y="Day",title ="Histogram of Average Temperature in Lake Wheeler")

# title and all labels included in one more statement 
```

ggplot(cardinal,aes(x=AvgHum,y=AvgLw))+geom_point()

# coloring by month to observe trends
ggplot(cardinal,aes(x=AvgHum,y=AvgLw))+geom_point(aes(col=month))
```


- We can also use categorical variables on the x-axis

```{r}

# + geom_boxplot is a great tool to observe spreads

ggplot(cardinal,aes(x=month , y = TDiff))+geom_boxplot()
```


- Box-plots are cumbersome and not super helpful in visalization. 


### How could we make this boxplot better? 

- Note we are looking at average daily tempurature

```{r}

# + geom_boxplot is a great tool to observe spreads

ggplot(cardinal,aes(x=month , y = AvgT))+geom_boxplot()
```


### Extra Bonus Plot Time


- Inspiration from ggridges documentation

- We want to stylize the boxplot from the above statement       

- We will be using a few libraries here: remeber to use `install.packages("library_name")` first before running the library statment.
